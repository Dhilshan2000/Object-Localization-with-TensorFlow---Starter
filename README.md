I have created and trained an Object Localization model using TensorFlow. In this project, I have used TensorFlow's Keras API to build a convolutional neural network tasked with classifying and localizing emojis in images. Localization, in this context, meant determining the position of the emojis within the images. The network had one input and two outputs. This task was akin to a simpler version of Object Detection. While Object Detection deals with multiple objects in images, each predicted with their classes and bounding boxes, Object Localization assumed only one object per image. My CNN model was designed to classify and localize that single object. It was a practical, hands-on project aimed at learners with prior programming experience in Python and familiarity with TensorFlow.
